# Log Welcome Messages to Students Using a Typed Array

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a teacher, I want to create a list of student names so that I can welcome them individually.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when `typescript` has successfully been installed as a `devDependency`.

* It's done when the total number of students is logged to the console.

* It's done when the message "Welcome to the class, STUDENT_NAME" is logged using each element in the array.

* It's done when the proper TypeScript type is applied to the array.

* It's done when the code transpiles without errors.

## üí° Hints

What is the first index in an array: 0 or 1?

What [Typescript types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html) are available?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we contain the names and ages of each student in one array, while still being strictly typed?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
