# üìñ Implement Inheritance in TypeScript

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to define various shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles, so I can calculate and display their areas and perimeters.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I've created `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` classes that inherit from the `Shape` class.

* It's done when I call the `displayInfo` method for each class and the correct values are displayed.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [TypeScript class heritage](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#class-heritage)

* [TypeScript extends clauses](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#extends-clauses)

## Assets

The output from the completed code should be similar to the following:

```shell
----------Circle----------
Area: 78.53981633974483
Perimeter: 31.41592653589793

----------Rectangle----------
Area: 24
Perimeter: 20

----------Triangle----------
Area: 6
Perimeter: 13
```

## üí° Hint

* How do we calculate the area of different shapes? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How does TypeScript inheritance make code more maintainable?
