# Update Functions to Correct Parameter and Return Types

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a developer, I want to ensure functions are checking the parameter and return types correctly.

## Expected Behavior

When I run `npm run start` to transpile the TypeScript file and run the Javascript file, no error messages should return. 

## Actual Behavior

When I run `npm run start` to transpile the TypeScript file and run the Javascript file, error messages display in the terminal. 

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. In the Unsolved folder, run `npm install` and `npm run start`.

2. Observe the output from the terminal.

## üí° Hints

* Take a look at the [documentation on anonymous functions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#anonymous-functions) for additional information on function types and corresponding parameters and return typings. 

* How does TypeScript handle anonymous functions and the parameters associated with them?

* How can you specify the function if it does not return any value? 

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you type the return type of a function that returns a function?
