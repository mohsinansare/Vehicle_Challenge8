// ? Primitive types in TypeScript are the same as JavaScript. They include: string, number, boolean, null, and undefined.

// String

let student = 'John';
let message = 'Hello World!';

// Number

let age = 30;
let price = 19.99;

// Boolean
let isDone = false;

// Null and Undefined are both values and types
let u = undefined;
let n = null;

// Any
let data; // ? The `any` type is a special type in TypeScript that can be used to represent any type. This is useful when you don't know the type of the data that will be assigned to a variable.

// Unknown

// ? The `unknown` type is another special type in TypeScript that is a similar, but safer alternative to `any`.

// Never

// ? The `never` type is used to represent values that will never occur.

// Void

// ? The `void` type is used to represent the absence of a type.
