# üìñ Use a TypeScript Interface to Define a Named Object Type

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use TypeScript interfaces to create named object types.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created an interface called Employee that describes all following employee objects.

* It's done when I update the objects to use the Employee interface.

* It's done when I update the review method to use the Employee interface.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[TypeScript docs on object types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html)

[TypeScript docs on interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#interfaces)

## üí° Hint

* If the object shapes do not match, how can we use optional properties to fit all objects?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is a type alias? How do type aliases compare to interfaces?
