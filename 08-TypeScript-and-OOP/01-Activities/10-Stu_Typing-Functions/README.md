# 📐 Add Comments and Implement Types for Variables, Function Parameters, and Return Values

Work with a partner to add comments for each type defining the function parameters and return values found in [10-Stu_Typing-Functions/Unsolved](./Unsolved/).

Add any missing types to variables, parameters, and return values.

Run `npm install` and `npm run build` without any errors.

## 📝 Notes

Some functions may not explicitly state their types.

Refer to the documentation:

* [Functions in TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#functions)

* [TypeScript everyday types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)

* [Basic JavaScript data types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How do you declare that a function type is optional?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
