# üìñ Implement Composition in TypeScript

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to define a drawing that contains various shapes, such as circles, rectangles, and triangles, so I can calculate and display the total area of the drawing.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I've created a drawing that holds multiple shapes.

* It's done when I call the `calculateTotalArea` method and the correct value is displayed.

## üìù Note

Refer to the documentation:

* [TypeScript class heritage](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#class-heritage)

## Assets

The output from the completed code should be similar to the following:

```shell
Total Area of Drawing: 100.53981633974483
```

---

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How does composition in TypeScript differ from inheritance?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
