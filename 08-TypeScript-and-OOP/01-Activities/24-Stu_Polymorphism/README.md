# üìñ Implement Polymorphism in TypeScript

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to define various shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles, so I can calculate and display the total area and perimeter for all of the shapes.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I've created `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` classes that implement the `Shape` interface.

* It's done when I've created an array to hold all the shapes.

* It's done when I call the `calculateTotalArea` method and the correct value is displayed.

* It's done when I call the `calculateTotalPerimeter` method and the correct value is displayed.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [TypeScript class heritage](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#class-heritage)

* [TypeScript implements clauses](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#implements-clauses)

## Assets

The output from the completed code should be similar to the following:

```shell
Total Area: 108.53981633974483
Total Perimeter: 64.41592653589794
```

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some reasons you would choose an interface instead of inheritance?
