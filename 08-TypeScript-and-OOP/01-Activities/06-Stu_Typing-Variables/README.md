# üèóÔ∏è Create Typed Variables

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a TypeScript application that edits and displays employee data assigned to different variables.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I open the project and a basic TypeScript project exists with proper file structure and `tsconfig` options.

* It's done when I run the application; TypeScript emits no errors, and the transpiled file runs in the console.

* It's done when variables are defined and typed for:

  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Age
  * Job Title
  * Salary
  * Remote Status

* It's done when I run the application and the employee's job title and salary are set.

* It's done when the employee's first name and last name are combined into one name.

* It's done when the employee information is logged to the console in a formatted template, listing the employee's name, age, job title, and salary.

* It's done when an employee's remote status is established as unknown. If the status is set to true, the sentence "EMPLOYEE_NAME is working remotely today" is displayed. Otherwise, display "EMPLOYEE_NAME is working from the office today."

* It's done when I run the application; the employee's job title is changed, the salary is increased by `10000`, and the employee information is displayed with the changes.

## üí° Hint

* Does every variable need to define a type?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How would we state that a variable could be multiple types?
